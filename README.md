## Flutter LawBot Mobile App
  Our project aims to develop an application that will help lawyers and judges by combining the subjects of law and artificial intelligence. This application will analyze the details in a case file using artificial intelligence and as a result predict a constitutional case outcome. In this way, the decision-making processes of lawyers and judges will be faster and more accurate.
